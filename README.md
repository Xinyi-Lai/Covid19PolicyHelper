### Inspiration
As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads out all over the world, we see different strategies adopted by different countries and states, and (maybe therefore), we see different characteristics and trends in the transmission of virus in different regions.  We think that it will be interesting to model the dynamics of the viral transmission using a differential equation model, and by controlling the transmission parameters, we can also model the future trend of the pandemic under different circumstances. What's more interesting, we believe that there exists some relationship between the transmission parameters and the environmental factors such as the control policy, hospital beds, mobility, population and so on....
